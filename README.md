# Code Repository for my Master Thesis

This repository contains the R code of my master thesis presented to the Department of Economics at Rheinische-Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn. The repository is set up as an RStudio project (*MA-repo.Rproj*) that needs to be opened for reproducibility. The file *Documentation.pdf* contains an overview and brief description of the R-files contained in this repository.

In my thesis, I deal with group heterogeneous panel data models and study a testing procedure developed by [Lu and Su (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE517) that aims to determine the unknown number of groups in the population. In the applied part I design a simulation study to investigate the weaknesses and strengths of the approach and employ the method to a real data example revisiting the study of democracy and economic growth by [Acemoglu et. al. (2019)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/700936?casa_token=2MbK9D8r4s4AAAAA%3AaO64NZsHQLwy-C8pJTkpPArEteBL_7OuYavhSwmsSjZ5eplZx3VQQSRz6FMYEClpSrBvf0NtIhwTPA).
